This repository contains a regularly updated version of survey data from our ACL 2024 paper “Media Framing: A typology and Survey of Computational Approaches Across Disciplines”. (link to be updated)

A TSV-file with the list of papers and their annotations is uploaded in this repo. In addition to the metadata (*Author*, *Title*, *Year*, *URL*), we specify the *language* targeted for framing analysis, and the type of the *venue* the study was published in (i.e. NLP such as ACL conferences or NLP tracks of other AI/CS conferences, Media studies, Social sciences, Political sciences and Other). We also show the *type and subtype of framing* explored in the paper, and if the methods presented in it are *theoretically grounded*. Please refer to our paper to learn more about these aspects.

You can find a filterable and searchable version of this list (also to be regularly updated) together with some dynamic charts [here](https://slow-resonance-1ba.notion.site/Media-framing-studies-78ca711f747a413f9e37d45e99ada81d).

We strive to keep this list correct and updated; if you find a paper that is not listed here or some errors, please let us know by raising an issue here or writing me at the email address in the paper. Thanks!

And please do not forget to cite us ;)
